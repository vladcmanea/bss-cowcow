# Blockchain CowCow
This is the smart contract part of the prototype for the course on Subjects in Blockchain Technology at the Blockchain Summer School in 2018.

The contracts are contained in `/contracts`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
For this you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/truffle) installed. You also need a local Ethereum network running. This can be [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache), which is the easiest way to get started. You can configure the development network settings in the `truffle.js` file.

### Installing
Run `npm install` in the root folder to install all dependencies.

### Running
To compile the contracts, run `truffle compile`. To run the test automation for the contracts, run `truffle test`. To deploy the contracts, run `truffle migrate`.

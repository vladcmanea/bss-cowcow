# Blockchain CowCow
This is the smart contract part of the prototype for the course on Subjects in Blockchain Technology at the Blockchain Summer School in 2018.

![Blockchain CowCow smart contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladcmanea/bss-cowcow/master/Tokens.png)

The contracts are contained in `/contracts`. The automated tests are contained in `/test`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
For this you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/truffle) installed. You also need a local Ethereum network running. This can be [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache), which is the easiest way to get started.

### Configuration

You can configure the development network settings in the `truffle.js` file.

### Installing
Run `npm install` in the root folder to install all dependencies.

### Running
To compile the contracts, run `truffle compile`. To run the test automation for the contracts, run `truffle test`. To deploy the contracts, run `truffle migrate`.
